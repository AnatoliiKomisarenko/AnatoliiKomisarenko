## Hi there !

### My name is Anatolii Komisarenko

After completing my postgraduate studies in environmental science, I've developed an interest in Data Analysis.

Since I began my studies at Practicum Bootcamp, I've grown to love SQL and Python.

I enjoy putting in a lot of effort when working on challenging projects.

Trying to find my dream job with a lot of it.
